## How to get it working?:
To run this app your going to need a couple of different pieces of software

## Node 
Which you can get here: https://nodejs.org/en/

## Yarn 
Which you can get here: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

## Git
Which you can get here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

#### Note: You may also need to create an account on this website ---> Github.com

# After you have all these pieces of software you can now download and run the web app by:

## Creating a new directory or folder where you want the file to be downloaded:
Navigate to the folder using the command line or command prompt in windows (aka use the cd command)
### Example: `cd C/Users/Jagoma/Desktop/FSBU`
This above command is just an example and will not work for you. Call me if you need help and I can 
walk you through working the command prompt.

## cloning the repo
using the command shown below should automatically download the files into the directory you created:
### Run this command: `git clone https://github.com/JamesGomatos/FSBU.git`

## Download Dependencies
You should now see the project was downloaded into the folder you created. 
Use the `cd` command in your command prompt to change into the directory that was created.

#### Example: `cd FSBU`
If you type the command ls you should see a package.json file listed

## Now you have to download the dependencies I used to create the project in the command prompt.
#### Run this command: `yarn install`

## Start the Project
#### Run this command: `yarn start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
